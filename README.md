ü§ñ Jarvis: Your Personal Virtual Assistant
Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant that responds to your voice commands to perform a variety of tasks, from opening websites to playing music and providing news headlines. It's built to be a simple, yet powerful, tool for hands-free computing.

‚ú® Features
Voice-Activated: Simply say the wake word "Jarvis" to get the assistant's attention.

Web Automation: Open popular websites like YouTube, Google, Facebook, and more with a simple command.

Music Player: Play specific songs from a predefined music library directly on YouTube.

News Updates: Get the latest top headlines from around the world.

AI Integration: Ask Jarvis any general question, and it will use OpenAI's GPT model to give you a detailed response.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Jarvis operates by listening for a specific wake word and then processing your subsequent commands. Here's a breakdown of the core components:

1. Voice Recognition
The project uses the speech_recognition library to capture audio from your microphone. It continuously listens for the wake word "Jarvis." Once the wake word is detected, it enters a command-listening mode, waiting for your instructions.

2. Command Processing
After capturing a command, the assistant analyzes the text to determine the user's intent. It uses a series of if/elif statements to match keywords in the command, such as "youtube," "play," or "news."

Web Browsing: If the command contains a keyword like "youtube," it uses the webbrowser library to open the corresponding URL.

Music Playback: For commands starting with "play," it looks up the song in the musicLibrary.py file and opens the associated YouTube link.

News API: When you say "news," it makes a request to the NewsAPI to fetch the latest headlines and speaks them aloud.

3. AI Integration
If a command doesn't match any of the predefined functions, Jarvis defaults to its AI capabilities. It sends your question to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The model processes the query, and its response is then spoken back to you, acting as a conversational and intelligent assistant.

4. Text-to-Speech
The assistant uses the pyttsx3 library to convert the text responses into speech, providing an auditory experience similar to other virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

A stable internet connection

Installation
Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd Jarvis

Install Required Libraries:
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 requests openai

Get API Keys:

OpenAI: You need an OpenAI API key for the AI functionality. Get one from the OpenAI Platform.

NewsAPI: You'll also need a NewsAPI key to fetch news headlines. Get one from the NewsAPI website.

Configure API Keys:

Open main.py and replace the placeholder API keys with your own:

Python

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
newsapi = "YOUR_NEWSAPI_KEY"
Run the Assistant:
python main.py
