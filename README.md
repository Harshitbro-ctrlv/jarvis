# jarvis
Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant that uses speech recognition to understand commands and text-to-speech to respond. It can open websites, play music from a defined library, fetch news headlines, and leverage OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo for general queries. The assistant listens for the "Jarvis" wake word to activate and process commands.
